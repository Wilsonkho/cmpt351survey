<p>myEARTHHOUR encourages all of us to make small changes in our lives that, when combined, amount to large, positive impact on the sustainability of our planet. You can participate as an individual by committing to environmentally-conscious Activities, earn Points by completing those Activities, and engage in friendly competition with others. In celebration of Earth Hour as an international movement, myEARTHHOUR is a personal tracking tool that encourages everyone to do a little more beyond the actual 60 minutes of Earth Hour.</p>

<p>myEARTHHOUR is operated by a team led by Dr. Leo Wong at MacEwan University as part of an academic research project, examining people’s environmentally-conscious activity commitments through the use of an online tracking software. This project has been approved by the Research Ethics Board at MacEwan University.</p>

<p>Research Team: Dr. Leo Wong (Principal Investigator), Dr. Indratmo (Co-Investigator), Dr. Sharon Bratt (Co-Investigator), Rannie Lou Rojas (Research Assistant), and Rebecca Dalke (Graphics Designer); Students in MacEwan University’s LENP 312 (Introduction to NonProfit Management); and other student volunteers at MacEwan University. An initial prototype of the application was developed by Ian Nalbach, David Sollinger, and Nathan Cairns. This project is supported by the City of Edmonton.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
